Ques : You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

    The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name,
    and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. 
    Exclude all hackers with a total score of  from your result.

Ans : SELECT 
    h.hacker_id,
    h.name,
    SUM(t.max_score) AS total_score
FROM Hackers h
JOIN (
    SELECT 
        hacker_id,
        challenge_id,
        MAX(score) AS max_score
    FROM Submissions
    GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id
) t
ON h.hacker_id = t.hacker_id
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING SUM(t.max_score) > 0
ORDER BY total_score DESC, h.hacker_id ASC;
