Que : Harry Potter and his friends are at Ollivander's with Ron, finally replacing Charlie's old broken wand.

Hermione decides the best way to choose is by determining the minimum number of gold galleons needed to buy each non-evil wand of high power and age.
Write a query to print the id, age, coins_needed, and power of the wands that Ron's interested in, sorted in order of descending power. If more than one wand has same power,
sort the result in order of descending age.

Ans : SELECT 
    w.id,
    wp.age,
    w.coins_needed,
    w.power
FROM Wands w
JOIN Wands_Property wp
    ON w.code = wp.code
WHERE wp.is_evil = 0
  AND w.coins_needed = (
        SELECT MIN(w2.coins_needed)
        FROM Wands w2
        JOIN Wands_Property wp2
            ON w2.code = wp2.code
        WHERE w2.power = w.power
          AND wp2.age = wp.age
          AND wp2.is_evil = 0
  )
ORDER BY 
    w.power DESC,
    wp.age DESC;
